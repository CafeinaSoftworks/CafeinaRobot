CafeinaRobot
============

By Daniel Ca√±izares Corrales

This was a short game that I made some years ago to teach programming in a fun way. It was used by my students and it worked well, but then it came Code.org and I realized that their games were better for learn programming so I decided to stop this project. Anyway, you can see the source code, critize it and maybe learn something.
